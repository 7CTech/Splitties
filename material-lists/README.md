This work in progress library aims to provide views for most, if not all, Material Design list items for your Android apps.

This library implementation should follow [the lists components part of Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/components/lists.html). It should aslo implement [lists controls](https://material.io/guidelines/components/lists-controls.html).

Feel free to open an issue if you need the implementation of a list item that is not in this library yet, or feel one can be improved. If so, contribution is welcome as long as the code style is kept intact (you can debate about it in an issue if you feel there's room for improvement).
