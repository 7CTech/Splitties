# View DSL

*Create UIs with readable Kotlin code.*

## Why a View DSL over xml layouts?

### Pros of xml layouts

* You can almost instantly preview a layout file (despite the huge RAM and CPU
usage)
* You can directly use xml styles with the `style` attribute
* You can declare a new id resource on the fly with `@+id/some_new_id`

### Cons of xml layouts

* You repeat `android` and `app` over and over, cluttering the code, resulting
in **hardly readable code**.
* Layout parameters and view attributes are mixed together and are not so well
ordered in some cases such as when using `ConstraintLayout`.
* Some things that affect your Views can only be done from code, leading to 2
problems: You can't preview them, and your **UI code is split over at least
2 files**.
* xml layout inflation involves **reflection**, which can slow down UI
creating, on large layouts and/or lower end devices.
* Some attributes that could make layout files easier to read like
**`horitontalMargin` and `verticalMargin` are only available on API 26+
in xml**.
* **If you support API 16 and lower, LTR support is subpar**.
When specifying start/end margins, you still need to specify left and right
values for API 16 or older (while start could default to left when RTL is not
supportedâ€¦). You also need to keep them in sync manually when you change the
values.
* You can't take advantage of Kotlin extensions and other Kotlin features.
* If you want to make your UI dynamic, you need to use code, and xml is not
really code, so you need to split your UI logic, being more error-prone in
the long run.
* Reusing parts of UI is hard and verbose, because you can only include other
files, but there's no things like functions for example.

### Pros of Splitties View DSL

* It is **concise** (most layouts converted from xml end up shorter, sometimes
even when counting the import lines).
* Is is **more expressive** and you can make it even better by defining
extension function or properties on the Views, LayoutParams, etc, so you can
hide a set of operations behind a simple function call. There are no
restrictions on the language features you can use in your UI code, you're not
just limited to xml available attributes and resources.
* You can **reuse UI code** in much more and easier ways than you can do
with xml layouts + code.
* Your **`Ui` can implement an interface** so you can easily swap
implementations. This can be handy for A/B testing, allowing more user
preferences to tweak or completely change the UI, and more.
* Layout direction defaults to LTR before API 17 and you can keep using
start/end without added boilerplate.
* **You can preview layouts in Android Studio** (requires build), with any
included logic being taken into account.
* Layout parameters are not mixed with View config.
* **No reflection** involved.

### Cons of Splitties View DSL

* Using xml defined styles (the ones you use with the `style` attribute)
can't be done directly in code and requires a small workaround (thankfully
an easy one: you need to create an xml file for the View you want to style
and to define a method to inflate it).
* Preview requires a build (but you're less likely to need preview thanks
to additional type safety and more expressive UI code).
